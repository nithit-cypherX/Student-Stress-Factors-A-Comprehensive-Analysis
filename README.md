# Student-Stress-Factors-A-Comprehensive-Analysis
we will explore how sleep quality impacts not only academic performance but also mental health and social engagement.
**By analyzing real student data, we aim to uncover whether better sleep truly leads to better performance across all aspects of student lifeâ€”or if sacrificing sleep for more study time is actually worth it. The results will help students, educators, and parents make informed decisions about the ideal balance between sleep and study for optimal success**.
